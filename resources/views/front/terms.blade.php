                        <h2>"Click&Boat" Service General Terms and Conditions of Use</h2>
                        <p>The general terms and conditions of use below are a translation provided in order to facilitate users’ understanding of the Service.</p>
                        <h3>1. 1. Definitions</h3>
                        <p>"Listing": a Rental or Co-Sailing offer published on the Site by an Owner,
                            "Boat-Manager": an intermediation concierge service for Owners covering Inventories of the Boat before and after use, the conclusion of Rental agreements and the reception of Renters on the Owners' behalf,
                            "GTCU": these general terms and conditions of use,
                            "Click&Boat": ClickandBoat, a simplified joint stock company with a capital of €6,143 , having its head office at Peniche West River, 10, quai du 4 septembre 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt, France, registered in the Paris Trade and Companies Register under number 801 157 256 and with ORIAS, the French insurance brokers' register, under number 15 005 093,
                            "Co-sailing": sailing activity where the costs of ownership, maintenance and use of the Boat are shared. The contribution, calculated by Owners under their sole responsibility, must be strictly limited to a proportion of these costs. Owners undertake not to make any profit from this activity. They acknowledge and accept that the receipt of any sum in addition to actual shared costs may entail the Co-Sailing arrangement's requalification as a transport activity, in which case Click&Boat declines any responsibility for the consequences,
                            "Click&Boat Commission": a commission percentage included in the Owner Price, payable by Owners as a fee for the service. The amount of this commission may vary, according to the contractual agreements between Click&Boat and Owners.
                            "Click&Boat Fees" means the fees associated with the operation of our platform that enable us to provide services such as customer support during your trip. VAT is included.</p>
                        <h3>2. Acceptance of the GTCU</h3>
                        <p>Use of the Service and the Site are subject to these GTCU. The GTCU constitute a contract governing the relationship between the User and Click&Boat. They supersede all previous provisions and constitute all the rights and obligations of Click&Boat and the User regarding their purpose. The Parties agree that in the event of any inconsistency between information on the Site and the GTCU, the latter take precedence.
                            Users are deemed to have fully and unreservedly accepted these GTCU once they tick the box "I accept the general terms and conditions" when creating their User accounts or registering for an offer.
                            If this box is not ticked, it will be impossible to create a User account or use the Service, which Users acknowledge.
                            Click&Boat reserves the right to modify the GTCU at any time, in which case the changes become effective when they are published on the Site. Continued use of the Site constitutes Users’ tacit acceptance of the latest updated version of the GTCU.</p>
