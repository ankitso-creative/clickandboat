                        immaculate—clean, spacious, and felt brand new, which made the experience even more enjoyable.
                        Jay was fantastic, making sure we felt completely at ease from the start. They were attentive,
                        offering drinks throughout the trip and ensuring we were comfortable. The captain was excellent,
                        providing a smooth and safe journey and stopping in great spots around the island of formentera.
                        Overall, it was a perfect day on the water, highly recommend Jay’s boat.",
